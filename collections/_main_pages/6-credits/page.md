[![Built with Spacemacs](https://cdn.rawgit.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/442d025779da2f62fc86c2082703697714db6514/assets/spacemacs-badge.svg)](https://develop.spacemacs.org)

As an Open Source nutter I need to thank the Open Source community, the [stack
overflow Q&A's](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/),
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/),
[Pop!_os](https://pop.system76.com/), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) in
particular.

This site wouldn't exist without [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org),
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). A huge thank you to
[@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) and the team at
[bootstrap](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people), and this site was revamped to
a version I adapted from @mdo's [hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/).

All the icons are from bootstrap-icons except for the tux icon which is from
[here](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/337128/linux_tux_os_penguin_icon) but modified
to not have the black surround.

This website was originally powered by [drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) with a
[theme ](https://www.drupal.org/project/druppio_small_business) from [Studio
Present](https://www.studiopresent.com/), original web design by [Marcos
Peñéñory](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcos-pe%C3%B1%C3%A9%C3%B1ory-b525921a).
